## About
Pong Star is a 2D space-themed take of the classic Pong game. In this game, players control ships to hit a ball back and forth in a space environment filled with planets and stars. As the programmer, I coded the main ball, player, and scoring mechanic. I also implement a photon multiplayer into the game that allows player to play multiplayer from different devices.
